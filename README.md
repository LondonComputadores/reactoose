## About reactoose

Welcome reactoose . This project acts as a template for front-end application's using React , Typescript , tailwindcss and Redux, along with several other tools and technologies.

React doesn't enforce any particular project structure. The good thing about this is that it allows you to make up a structure to suit your needs without being tied to any particular way of doing things. The bad thing is that it is not possible to provide you an ideal structure that would work for every project.

## Advantages of a Project Structure

Teams donâ€™t have to argue on project structure, instead they can focus on building the product. People with less experience can also build scalable projects. Code sharing + reuse is increased as a more modular structure is created. Consistent structure across projects helps people get acquainted with the project quickly. A quick peek and we can guess what each folder will contain, lowering the learning curve for new team members.
